                    Hello everyone! <br/><br/>
                    My name is Butler Mole and I am the Mascot of Josephine Butler College. I am a friendly, lovable mole who loves to have fun and make new friends. <br/><br/>
                    As the College Mascot, my job is to represent the students of Josephine Butler College and to promote college spirit. I attend all of the college's social events and help out with any college fundraisers. I also make appearances at Durham University's sporting events to support the team.<br/><br/>
                    I absolutely love my job and I feel very lucky to be a part of such a great college community. I would encourage all students, whether they are in Josephine Butler College or not, to get involved with their college's JCR. It's a great way to meet new people and have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>
                    There are many different types of animals that can be found around Durham University's campus. Some of these include: squirrels, rabbits, ducks, geese, and of course, moles! I encourage everyone to take the time to appreciate all of the different types of wildlife that can be found around Durham.<br/><br/>
                    Thank you all for your time and I hope to see you around campus soon!
